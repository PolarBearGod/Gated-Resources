# Gated Security Resources

As a general rule of thumb, I do not support horrid business practices like this. Forcing people to sign up for your service or your email spam list increases risk for all parties involved. Part of the skills gap is in part due to companies that feel the need to lock their "public" reports, documents, etc.

Now there is ANOTHER database with ANOTHER email (and sometimes password) that can be breached. If you are providing these services or your organization does stupid marketing stunts like this, please... just stop.
