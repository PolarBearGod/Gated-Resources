# Gated Security Resources

As a general rule of thumb, I do not support horrid business practices like forcing people to sign up for your service or your email spam list just to get a whitepaper or to read a blog. Overall, it increases risk for all parties involved. Part of the infosec skills gap is in part due to companies that feel the need to lock their "public" reports, documents, etc. behind these fake gateways.

Now there is ANOTHER database with ANOTHER email (and sometimes password) that can be breached. If you are providing these services or your organization does stupid marketing stunts like this, please... just stop. 

For those that want to commit to this repo please using the following naming convention:  
`Company-Name_Title-of-the-paper.EXTENSION`

* Name of the "offending" company first
* Under score to seperate the company name from the title of the paper
* No spaces or whitespace allowed in the title, please use dashes
* Extension must be a known extension type, most perferable PDF

All commits will be scanned via VirusTotal and or another tool to ensure no malware is embedded.
